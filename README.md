<h1>Problem 1: Logistics (0 points)</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Ensure you have a picture on D2L</li>

 <li>Install MATLAB on your computer and bring it to class (if you can)</li>

</ul>

<h1>Problem 2: MATLAB Practice (10 points)</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Write the MATLAB script that does the following steps

  <ul>

   <li>Create an array <em>A </em>of 20 zeros</li>

   <li>Put a 1 in the second entry in the array, i.e., <em>A </em>= [0<em>,</em>1<em>,</em>0<em>,…,</em>0]</li>

   <li>Loop over the third to twentieth entries and compute the value by adding the previous two values.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

For example <em>A</em>(3) = <em>A</em>(1) + <em>A</em>(2) and <em>A</em>(4) = <em>A</em>(2) + <em>A</em>(3).

<ul>

 <li>Display the final result along with the name of this famous sequence of numbers</li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li>Create a line plot of the functions <em>y </em>= sin(<em>x</em>) and <em>y </em>= cos(<em>x</em>) on the interval <em>x </em>= [−<em>π,π</em>] with 1000 grid points. Label your axes, adjust the font size so the figure looks good, add a legend with line types that easily distinguishable.</li>

 <li></li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li>Find a picture that depicts your summer and use MATLAB to display the image with a title and caption describing the activity.</li>

 <li>Using the Publish feature in MATLAB, save your code and output as a pdf with the filename following this convention. File Naming: All MATLAB scripts should follow the following format</li>

</ul>

Lastname_Firstname_Sec###_HW#.m

Example: For John Doe homework assignment 1 for section 003 it would be written as

Doe_John_Sec003_HW1.m

Turn in the PDF of your MATLAB code that includes your output (e.g., figures) to GRADESCOPE. Also, upload your code (m-file) to the assignment folder on D2L. <em>Be</em> <em>sure</em> <em>your</em> <em>code</em> <em>h</em><em>as</em> <em>comments</em> <em>explaining</em> <em>what</em> <em>is</em> <em>being</em> <em>done,</em> <em>as</em> <em>this</em> <em>is</em> <em>good</em> <em>programming</em> <em>practice.</em>
